# TheBeanstalk
The Beanstalk is a third person endless climber game. The goal is to climb up a randomly generated beanstalk as high as possible. The beanstalk itself has got some variation to offer. The player can save his highscore inside a profile and level the abilities of this profile up (ingame it's called training).
This version is the Build PT01LT05Q15 or simply the a developers testing version of the "Competition Update" with every script being commented and made prettier.
